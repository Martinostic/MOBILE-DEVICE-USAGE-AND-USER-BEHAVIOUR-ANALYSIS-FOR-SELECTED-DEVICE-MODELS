ANALYSIS OF UNIVERSITY MATRICULATION EXAMINATION PERFORMANCE (YEAR 2023)

Project Summary
This project examines the factors influencing the performance of candidates in the 2023 University Matriculation Examination. Key variables analyzed include extra tutorials, parental involvement, access to learning materials, socioeconomic status, location, and parental education level. The study uses data visualization to highlight the impact of these factors and provide actionable insights to stakeholders in the education sector.

Key Skills

Data Analysis: Identifying key drivers of performance and extracting insights from examination data.
Business Intelligence: Designing intuitive dashboards for better interpretation of student performance metrics.
Data Visualization: Using Power BI to represent data trends and correlations visually.
Performance Benchmarking: Comparing the impact of multiple factors on performance outcomes.
Educational Insights Development: Analyzing educational data to guide policies and improve student outcomes.

Methodology

Data Collection: Candidate performance data was gathered along with details on various influencing factors such as socioeconomic background and educational resources.
Data Visualization: Charts and graphs were developed to visualize trends and correlations between the examined factors.
Trend Analysis: Patterns were identified to understand which variables have the strongest influence on performance.
Performance Benchmarking: Candidates' scores were assessed against the influence of external and internal factors.

OBSERVATIONS

Effect of Extra Tutorials:
Candidates who attended extra tutorials (55.34%) generally performed better than those who did not (44.66%).
Parental Involvement:
Performance is highest among students with medium parental involvement (346,653), while low involvement yields better results (313,934) than high involvement (209,786).
Access to Learning Materials:
A significant majority (67.5%) of students with access to learning materials showed improved performance compared to 32.5% without access.
Effect of Location:
Rural students (57.1%) outperformed their urban counterparts (42.9%) on average.
Parental Education Level:
Students whose parents had secondary education performed the best (274,748), followed by those with primary (225,765), tertiary (225,011), and no education (144,849).
Socioeconomic Status:
Medium socioeconomic status corresponds to the highest performance (342,516), followed by low (321,471) and high (206,386).

RECOMMENDATIONS

Expand Access to Learning Materials:
Governments and educational institutions should prioritize providing learning resources, particularly to underserved communities, to bridge performance gaps.
Encourage Effective Parental Involvement:
Parental involvement strategies should aim for balanced engagement, avoiding extremes that may hinder student independence.
Promote Extra Tutorials:
Schools and policymakers should encourage and subsidize tutorial programs, which have a clear positive impact on performance.
Support Rural Education Programs:
Invest in rural education to sustain the high performance of rural students while addressing infrastructure and resource gaps.
Parental Education Campaigns:
Initiatives to educate parents, especially up to the secondary level, could indirectly boost their childrenâ€™s academic success.
Focus on Medium Socioeconomic Groups:
Tailored programs that uplift low-income households while mitigating challenges faced by high-income students could balance disparities in performance.
